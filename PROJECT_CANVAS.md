## Project Name

AI-Powered Amazon Product Assistant (B2C)

## Project Goal

Develop a production-grade, AI-powered product assistant that helps users interact with Amazon-style product data via natural language. The assistant uses a complete RAG implementation to answer product-related questions, surface relevant information from reviews, and provide intelligent recommendations – demonstrating end-to-end AI engineering with vector databases and context-aware retrieval.

## Problem Statement

Online shoppers face information overload and often struggle to find the right product insights in massive marketplaces. Our AI assistant addresses this by retrieving and summarizing key data (e.g., reviews, ratings, product features) to support better and faster purchase decisions.

## Out-of-Scope (B2B Scope)

- contractual pricing
- account-specific catalogs
- procurement compliance
- multi-user workflows (approvers, requisitioners, etc.)
- Bulk ordering, BOM-style inputs, or quote-based negotiation are not captured
- ERP integration, punchout catalogs (OCI, cXML)
- product taxonomies (e.g. ETIM, UNSPSC)

## Target Users

- End consumers browsing for specific products
- Customer support agents
- E-commerce platform operators aiming to enhance product discoverability

## Data Source

### Public Amazon product datasets

- Metadata (title, brand, category, etc.)
- Reviews (text, rating, verified purchase flag, helpful votes)

### Subset focus

Selected product category (e.g., electronics, kitchenware) with a few thousand entries for initial development and indexing.

## Key Use Cases

- "What do people say about [Product X]?"
- "Is this product good for [specific use case]?"
- "What are the main complaints about [Product Y]?"
- "Compare [Product A] and [Product B]"
- "Recommend a budget-friendly alternative to [Product Z]"
